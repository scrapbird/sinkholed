# Sinkholed AWS Configuration 

A collection of terraform templates that can be used to bring up a production ready implementation of sinkholed on AWS.

**Note:** This is a work in progress. It is mainly all here but it needs polish. I did the bulk of this in a day so there is still work to do.

## TODO

* Check all IAM polcies
* Check all security group policies
* Revisit module boundries / variables
* Fix: "Error indexing event: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority"
